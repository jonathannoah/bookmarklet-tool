# OpenURL Bookmarklet Creator

This tool allows libraries to create bookmarklets that end users may use to navigate directly to a library link resolver
from any publisher webpage.

The bookmarklet automatically creates an OpenURL-compliant link to the link resolver based on metadata found within the
webpage. The bookmarklet will also create a link based on a highlighted DOI if text is selected when the user clicks the
bookmarklet.
